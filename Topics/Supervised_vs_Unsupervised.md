## Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

In machine learning, **Supervised Learning** and **Unsupervised Learning** are two foundational approaches. Below is a comprehensive comparison, along with examples of algorithms used in each type:

| Feature                | **Supervised Learning**                               | **Unsupervised Learning**                              |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | Training on labeled data to predict outputs for new data. | Training on unlabeled data to find patterns or structure. |
| **Data Requirements**  | Requires labeled data (inputs paired with outputs).    | Works with unlabeled data.                            |
| **Goal**               | Predict outcomes (classification or regression).      | Discover hidden structures or patterns in data.       |
| **Output**             | Predictive models with known target labels.           | Clustering, association, or dimensionality reduction. |
| **Algorithms**         | - Linear Regression<br>- Logistic Regression<br>- Decision Trees<br>- Random Forest<br>- SVM<br>- Neural Networks | - K-Means Clustering<br>- DBSCAN<br>- Hierarchical Clustering<br>- PCA<br>- Autoencoders<br>- t-SNE |
| **Use Cases**          | - Spam detection<br>- Fraud detection<br>- Image recognition<br>- Stock price prediction | - Market segmentation<br>- Anomaly detection<br>- Data compression<br>- Recommendation systems |

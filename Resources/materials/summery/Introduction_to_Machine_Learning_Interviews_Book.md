## Overview
The job search process for machine learning roles is long, stressful, and varies by location. This summary provides a practical timeline and resources to prepare effectively.

---

### **Recommended Timeline**

1. **Start Early:**  
   - Begin your search **3–6 months** before your target start date.  
   - Students: Start at the beginning of your final year.  
   - In regions like Germany, account for **3-month notice periods**.  
   - Visa applicants: Factor in visa processing time.

2. **One Year Prior:**  
   - Build your online presence (e.g., GitHub projects).  
   - Complete assignments in online courses.  
   - Participate in Kaggle competitions.  
   - Reimplement interesting research papers.

3. **Three Months Before Interviews:**  
   - Take 2–3 courses:  
     - Hands-on: [Fast.ai's Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/).  
     - Theoretical: [Coursera's Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).  
     - Practical: [CS329S: Machine Learning Systems Design (Stanford)](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/).

# 4.2 How Other People Did It

## Overview
Learning from the career paths of others can provide valuable insights and inspiration. There is no single route to a career in machine learning (ML). People with unconventional backgrounds often bring unique perspectives and are highly sought after. This section highlights a few inspiring stories of individuals who carved their own paths into ML roles.

---

### **Key Stories**

1. **Shifting Careers to Autonomous Vehicles**  
   Vladimir Iglovikov, a Senior Computer Vision Engineer at Lyft, transitioned from debt collection to self-driving cars. He shared his challenges, including rejection from Google and NVIDIA, and the rescinding of a Tesla offer due to an NDA violation. His story reflects the immigration frustrations many face when seeking opportunities abroad.

2. **A Focused Study Plan for Google Interviews**  
   John Washam dedicated 8 months to full-time study for a Google interview. Despite being rejected by Google, his persistence led to an offer from Amazon, demonstrating resilience and adaptability.

3. **Strategic Job Search After Layoff**  
   Emma Ding analyzed data science job listings and categorized them into three roles: Product Analytics, Modeling, and Data Engineering. She targeted Product Analytics, enhanced her resume, and prepared intensively. Within two months, she received 10 interviews, 4 onsite interviews, and 4 job offers from companies including Twitter, Lyft, and Airbnb.

4. **Self-Taught Machine Learning Researcher**  
   Emil Wallner, a resident at Google Arts & Culture, taught himself ML. His recommended learning path:  
   - Learn coding fundamentals.  
   - Spend 1–2 months completing [Fast.ai's course](https://course.fast.ai/).  
   - Dedicate 4–5 months to personal projects or ML competitions.

---

### Insights
- **Diverse Backgrounds Add Value:** Candidates from unconventional paths often bring innovative ideas and perspectives.
- **Perseverance Pays Off:** Setbacks and rejections are part of the journey but can lead to growth and success.  
- **Focused Preparation:** A strategic approach to skills development and job targeting can yield significant results.


# 4.3 Resources

## Overview
The most effective way to become an ML engineer is to focus on hands-on learning. Doing projects, taking courses, and actively participating in coding communities are highly effective. College education ranks slightly above YouTube tutorials and blogs in perceived usefulness, while podcasts, newsletters, and conferences are considered the least effective for skill-building. However, conferences are excellent for networking and showcasing research through publications.

---

### Key Takeaways
- **Effective Methods:**  
  - Projects  
  - Courses  
  - StackOverflow participation  
  - Kaggle competitions (some bias applies)  

- **Networking vs. Skill Building:**  
  - Conferences are better for networking and career exposure than for building technical skills.  
  - Publishing research at conferences enhances credibility and visibility.

- **Don’t Dwell on Failures:** Move on and apply to other companies or revisit your dream company later.


# Part II: Questions

## Overview
This section features over 200 deterministic questions designed to test your understanding of machine learning concepts. These questions help interviewers evaluate your knowledge and thought process. The questions are categorized into three difficulty levels:  
- **[E]asy:** Fundamental concepts everyone should know.  
- **[M]edium:** Concepts requiring a deeper understanding beyond definitions.  
- **[H]ard:** Advanced topics that demonstrate practical experience.  

### Key Highlights:
- **Purpose:** The questions focus on understanding "why" something matters and "how" it works rather than rote memorization or solving equations.  
- **Types of Questions:** Some "bad" interview questions (e.g., definitions) are included for practice, as they reinforce the importance of certain concepts.  
- **Strategy for Definitions:** Always start with the motivation behind the concept. For example, when explaining LSTMs, begin by discussing the limitations of standard RNNs and how LSTMs address them.  
- **Interviewer Approach:** In a typical hour-long interview, 10-15 of these questions might be covered.  

### Additional Tips:
- Understand the foundational challenges in machine learning, as they persist regardless of evolving techniques.  
- Focus on "why" questions to demonstrate a deeper grasp of concepts.  


# Chapter 5: Math

## Overview
If you're primarily running pre-existing ML code (like `keras.fit`) without developing new models, this chapter may not be necessary for you. However, a solid understanding of math will greatly enhance your ability to:

- Evaluate trade-offs between different algorithms.
- Debug your models and fix issues during training.
- Make performance or efficiency improvements.
- Explain your model’s performance.
- Develop new models from scratch.

### Key Mathematical Areas in ML:

- **Calculus** (minimal) and **Convex Optimization**

Note: This section doesn’t cover all possible math areas in ML, such as **graph theory, logic**, or **topology**.

### Notation:
- All vectors are column vectors.
- Superscripts denote the sample index; the element is denoted by the subscript.
- For matrices, the first row is denoted by a subscript.

### Topics in Chapter 5:
#### Vectors
- **Dot Product:**
  - Geometric interpretation of the dot product of two vectors.
  - Find a unit vector to maximize its dot product with another vector.
- **Outer Product:**
  - Definition and calculation of the outer product.
  - How the outer product can be useful in ML.
- **Linear Independence:**
  - What it means for vectors to be linearly independent.

This chapter introduces fundamental math concepts that will aid in solving practical machine learning problems.

## 5.1 Algebra and (little) calculus
### 5.1.1 Vectors

#### Dot Product
[E] What’s the geometric interpretation of the dot product of two vectors?
  - The dot product of two vectors **A** and **B** is a scalar given by:  
    ```
    A · B = |A| * |B| * cos(θ)
    ```  
    where |**A**| and |**B**| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.  
  - **Geometric Interpretation:**  
    - The dot product represents the projection of **A** onto **B**, scaled by the magnitude of **B**.  
    - If the dot product is:  
      - **Positive:** The angle θ is acute (vectors point in similar directions).  
      - **Negative:** The angle θ is obtuse (vectors point in opposite directions).  
      - **Zero:** The vectors are perpendicular (θ = 90°).  
  - **Visualization:**  
    - Imagine projecting **A** onto **B**. The dot product gives the length of this projection, multiplied by |**B**|.


[E] Given a vector, find vector of unit length such that the dot product of and is maximum.
- The vector **v** that maximizes the dot product with **u** is the unit vector in the direction of **u** (i.e., **v** = **u** / ||**u**||).

#### Outer Product
[E] Given two vectors and . Calculate the outer product ?
[M] Give an example of how the outer product can be useful in ML.
[E] What does it mean for two vectors to be linearly independent?

#### Linear Independence
[M] Given two sets of vectors and . How do you check that they share the same basis?
[M] Given vectors, each of dimensions. What is the dimension of their span?

#### Norms and Metrics
[E] What's a norm? What is ?
[M] How do norm and metric differ? Given a norm, make a metric. Given a metric, can we make a norm?

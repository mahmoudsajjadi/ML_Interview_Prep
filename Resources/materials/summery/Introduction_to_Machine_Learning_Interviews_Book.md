# Summary: 4.1 How long do I need for my job search?

## Overview
The job search process for machine learning roles is long, stressful, and varies by location. This summary provides a practical timeline and resources to prepare effectively.

---

### **Recommended Timeline**

1. **Start Early:**  
   - Begin your search **3–6 months** before your target start date.  
   - Students: Start at the beginning of your final year.  
   - In regions like Germany, account for **3-month notice periods**.  
   - Visa applicants: Factor in visa processing time.

2. **One Year Prior:**  
   - Build your online presence (e.g., GitHub projects).  
   - Complete assignments in online courses.  
   - Participate in Kaggle competitions.  
   - Reimplement interesting research papers.

3. **Three Months Before Interviews:**  
   - Take 2–3 courses:  
     - Hands-on: [Fast.ai's Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/).  
     - Theoretical: [Coursera's Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).  
     - Practical: [CS329S: Machine Learning Systems Design (Stanford)](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/).  
   - Read 2–3 books:  
     - [Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/).  
     - [Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin P. Murphy](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/).  

4. **One Week Before:**  
   - Review notes from:  
     - [CS231N: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/).  
     - [Full Stack Deep Learning Lectures](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/).  
   - Skim through **Part 2 and 3** of the book.  
   - Revisit your project details for potential interview discussions.

5. **One Day Before:**  
   - Sleep well.  
   - Avoid last-minute cramming.  
   - Arrive 10 minutes early to settle in.

### Key Insights

- **Consistency Wins:**  
  Becoming a machine learning expert requires years, not months.  
  Refer to Peter Norvig's [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](https://norvig.com/21-days.html).  

- **Plan Ahead:**  
  If unsuccessful, analyze feedback and repeat the process.

# Summary: 4.2 How Other People Did It

## Overview
Learning from the career paths of others can provide valuable insights and inspiration. There is no single route to a career in machine learning (ML). People with unconventional backgrounds often bring unique perspectives and are highly sought after. This section highlights a few inspiring stories of individuals who carved their own paths into ML roles.

---

### **Key Stories**

1. **Shifting Careers to Autonomous Vehicles**  
   Vladimir Iglovikov, a Senior Computer Vision Engineer at Lyft, transitioned from debt collection to self-driving cars. He shared his challenges, including rejection from Google and NVIDIA, and the rescinding of a Tesla offer due to an NDA violation. His story reflects the immigration frustrations many face when seeking opportunities abroad.

2. **A Focused Study Plan for Google Interviews**  
   John Washam dedicated 8 months to full-time study for a Google interview. Despite being rejected by Google, his persistence led to an offer from Amazon, demonstrating resilience and adaptability.

3. **Strategic Job Search After Layoff**  
   Emma Ding analyzed data science job listings and categorized them into three roles: Product Analytics, Modeling, and Data Engineering. She targeted Product Analytics, enhanced her resume, and prepared intensively. Within two months, she received 10 interviews, 4 onsite interviews, and 4 job offers from companies including Twitter, Lyft, and Airbnb.

4. **Self-Taught Machine Learning Researcher**  
   Emil Wallner, a resident at Google Arts & Culture, taught himself ML. His recommended learning path:  
   - Learn coding fundamentals.  
   - Spend 1–2 months completing [Fast.ai's course](https://course.fast.ai/).  
   - Dedicate 4–5 months to personal projects or ML competitions.

### Insights
- **Diverse Backgrounds Add Value:** Candidates from unconventional paths often bring innovative ideas and perspectives.
- **Perseverance Pays Off:** Setbacks and rejections are part of the journey but can lead to growth and success.  
- **Focused Preparation:** A strategic approach to skills development and job targeting can yield significant results.

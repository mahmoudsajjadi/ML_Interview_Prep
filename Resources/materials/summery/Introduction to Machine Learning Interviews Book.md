# Summary: 4.1 How long do I need for my job search?

## Overview
The job search process for machine learning roles is long, stressful, and varies by location. This summary provides a practical timeline and resources to prepare effectively.

---

### **Recommended Timeline**
1. **Start Early:**  
   - Begin your search **3–6 months** before your target start date.  
   - Students: Start at the beginning of your final year.  
   - In regions like Germany, account for **3-month notice periods**.  
   - Visa applicants: Factor in visa processing time.

2. **One Year Prior:**  
   - Build your online presence (e.g., GitHub projects).  
   - Complete assignments in online courses.  
   - Participate in Kaggle competitions.  
   - Reimplement interesting research papers.

3. **Three Months Before Interviews:**  
   - Take 2–3 courses:  
     - Hands-on: [Fast.ai's Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/).  
     - Theoretical: [Coursera's Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).  
     - Practical: [Machine Learning Systems Design by Chip Huyen](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/).  
   - Read 2–3 books:  
     - [Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/).  
     - [Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin P. Murphy](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047703/).  

4. **One Week Before:**  
   - Review notes from:  
     - [CS231N: Convolutional Neural Networks](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/).  
     - [Full Stack Deep Learning Lectures](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/).  
   - Skim through **Part 2 and 3** of the book.  
   - Revisit your project details for potential interview discussions.

5. **One Day Before:**  
   - Sleep well.  
   - Avoid last-minute cramming.  
   - Arrive 10 minutes early to settle in.

### Key Insights
- **Consistency Wins:**  
  Becoming a machine learning expert requires years, not months.  
  Refer to Peter Norvig's [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](https://norvig.com/21-days.html).  

- **Plan Ahead:**  
  If unsuccessful, analyze feedback and repeat the process.
